              <h2>Karen Nairobi </h2>
              <p class="py-1 my-2 text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
                  After Kenya declared independence from British rule in 1963, there came a flood of renaming. Schools, suburbs, and roads were rechristened in ways that spoke to a new idea of what it meant to be authentically Kenyan. In Nairobi, &ldquo;Queens Way&rdquo; became &ldquo;Mama Ngina Street,&rdquo; and roads named after the first four colonial commissioners were redesignated for African leaders: Dedan Kimathi, Muindi Mbingu, Daudi Dabasso Wabera, and Mbiyu Koinange, respectively. One appellation that escaped the fate of the rest was &ldquo;<strong>Karen</strong>&rdquo; &mdash; the name of a Nairobi suburb, presumably christened for the Baroness <strong>Karen Blixen</strong>, the Danish writer also known as Isak Dinesen. <strong>Karen Nairobi</strong> lies 17 kilometers west of the Nairobi city centre and is one of a few Nairobi suburbs where tall jacarandas loom large, straddling long driveways onto huge mansions with plush gardens. Karen is a suburb of Nairobi in Kenya, lying south-west of Nairobi's central business district. The suburb of Karen borders the <strong>Ngong Forest</strong> and is home to the Ngong Racecourse. Karen and Langata previously formed a somewhat isolated area of mid to high-income residents, but the two suburbs have become increasingly interconnected and linked to the rest of Nairobi through the expansion of the eponymous Langata Road and Ngong Road, the latter project completed in 2021. Karen was previously in Ngong County. After Nairobi received city status in 1950 the counties were redefined. In 1963 Karen was placed under the Nairobi City Council's administration.Karen hosts diplomats, powerful business people, the upper strata of Kenya&rsquo;s political class, expatriates, and much of Kenya&rsquo;s privileged white, Asian, and Black populations. Karen contemporary ethos was unintentionally revealed in a New York Times Style story about the suburb&rsquo;s upscale boutiques in which every single shop-owner and fashion designer mentioned is a white woman, including the Swedish proprietor of a shop called &ldquo;Bush Princess.&rdquo; Karen, we learn, is &ldquo;home to some of the city&rsquo;s most intriguing and exclusive places to shop.&rdquo; In Karen today, you can breakfast with the endangered Rothschild giraffes at <strong>Giraffe Manor</strong>, or adopt an elephant at the<strong> David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.</strong> And, of course, you can visit the <strong>Karen Blixen Museum</strong>, in the house where the baroness once lived. <strong>Karen Blixen</strong>, a Danish aristocrat, moved to Kenya at the height of Empire, in 1913, with her new husband, 15,000 Danish crowns, and the intention to start a coffee farm. It was only later, after she returned to Denmark in 1931, that she gradually found fame as a writer. Her 1937 memoir, Out of Africa, offers a record of her time in Kenya, detailing her relationships with her lovers, her servants, and the two thousand &ldquo;Natives&rdquo; who lived on her farm. As Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o, the grand old man of Kenyan letters, later wrote, &ldquo;As if in compensation for unfulfilled desires and longings, the baroness turned Kenya into a vast erotic dreamland in which her several white lovers appeared as young gods and her Kenyan servants as usable curs and other animals, deserted by her husband, <strong>Karen</strong> threw herself into the hedonistic social life available to the European gentry in the colony. When the Duke and Prince of Wales came to visit, she made the local Kikuyu perform a dance in their honor. She and her lover, British big game hunter <strong>Denys Finch-Hatton</strong>, oscillated in and out of the &ldquo;Happy Valley set,&rdquo; described by Ulf Aschan, the godson of Blixen&rsquo;s husband, as &ldquo;relentless in their pursuit to be amused, more often attaining this through drink, drugs, and sex.&rdquo; A popular question among British aristocrats at the time was, &ldquo;Are you married or do you live in Kenya?&rdquo; None of this appears in Blixen&rsquo;s memoir, which skips over wild parties in favor of providing lush detail about the landscape and the &ldquo;Natives.&rdquo; <strong>Karen Blixen</strong> home is still standing and forms the centerpiece of the <strong>Karen Blixen Museum</strong>, a key local tourist attraction. Other tourist attractions are the <strong>AFEW Karen Giraffe Center</strong>, the exclusive <strong>Giraffe Manor</strong>, the <strong>Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage</strong>, and the Oloolua Forest nature trails. Karen gives you this feeling of being in an affluent community, one thing that&rsquo;s definitely noticeable is the calmness of the area and the fresh aroma from the swaying trees, life here is well above the reach of most Nairobi locals, making it one of the least populated Nairobi suburbs, many people who inhabit Karen are Europeans and high-income locals who can afford to buy the expensive properties, If you are looking for some leisure time in <strong>Karen Nairobi</strong> you&rsquo;ll be amazed by what it has to offer.

The garden can be rented out for <strong>wedding receptions</strong> and other event functions like hosting parties.</p>
            <h4>The Giraffe Centre and Sanctuary </h4>
              <p class="text-justify">The <strong>Karen Giraffe Center Sanctuary</strong> offers you the chance to meet, pet, and kiss a giraffe. The <strong>Karen Giraffe sanctuary</strong> was created to save the endangered Rothschild Giraffes. As part of the <strong>Giraffe center in Karen</strong>, the Giraffe Centre was built to allow people to come close to the animals. The Karen Giraffe Centre has created an elaborate walkway system that enables you to get head height with our tall friends. Grab a couple of pellets and hand-feed the giraffes. Afterwards, you can buy a coffee, shop for crafts or even take a walk in the sanctuary itself &ndash; watch out though, there are tons of warthogs.&nbsp;</p>

Carers become substitute parents, which often involves sleeping in the elephant&rsquo;s pens at night, applying sunscreen and feeding them from gigantic baby bottles.&nbsp;You can visit <strong>David Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage</strong> at 11 am each day for a formal talk about the work the organization does. Even better, sponsor an elephant in advance and bag a VIP visit to the elephants at 5 pm (pre-booking only). On this VIP visit, you can watch the elephant feed, meet the keepers, interact with the elephants one to one and watch them being put to bed. It&rsquo;s magical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="text-justify">If you don&rsquo;t have time to do a <strong>safari in Nairobi National Park</strong>, or you want to guarantee a sighting of animals, then the <strong>Safari Walk</strong> is a great option.
